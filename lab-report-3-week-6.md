## Streamlining ssh Configuration


## ssh Configuration

Inside C:\Users\Rachel\.ssh I added a file called config.  Even though it only contains text, it is important that this file is saved as type File and not Text Document.  I used Notepad to edit and paste the given text into this file.


## Logging in
![ssh](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97620200/153480491-b78d50db-98d9-4a97-9698-7085c1eb0bd9.jpg)
Now, all I need to do is type into the command line `ssh ieng6` 

## Using the scp command
