## Finding Different Results

After running script.sh I manually searched through the results.  After Lab 9, with the added code to identify which test file contains all the required brackets and parantheses, I looked for results where my markdown-parse's output was not an empty list, and the given implementation returned an empty string even though the brackets and parantheses were found.
